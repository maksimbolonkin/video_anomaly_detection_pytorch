# Video anomaly detection
This is a PyTorch implementation of the model described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01546) by Yong Shean Chong and Yong Haur Tay. Code is adapted from [here](https://github.com/blackeagle01/Abnormal_Event_Detection) and [here] (https://github.com/hashemsellat/Video-Anomaly-Detection). ConvLSTM layer implementation is adapted from [here](https://github.com/automan000/Convolution_LSTM_PyTorch) and [here](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch). Dataset used for training and inference is UCSD Pedestrian Anomaly dataset.
